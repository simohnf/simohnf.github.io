sjf_mangler2 is a sample manipulator that creates randomised variations to looped audio.
Just like sjf_mangler it can create variations on playback including segment reversals, playback speed changes, beat repeats, amplitide chanegs, and segment shuffling.
The device includes the ability to sync playback to the host DAW's tempo, the potential to create patterns which do not follow the original time signature, and 6 different interpolation algorithms.
As an advancement of sjf_mangler, sjf_mangler2 also includes the potential to load multiple samples at once and have each step of the pattern chosen from amongst these samples according to user set probabilities.
