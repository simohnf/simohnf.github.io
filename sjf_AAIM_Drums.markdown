sjf_AAIM_Drums combines the [AAIM_rhythmGen and AAIM_patternVary](/AAIM/) algorithms in a 16 voice drum sequencer designed to facilitate the manipulation of drum patterns in real time.

The plug-in alows users to specify up to 16 different patterns, each of which can have a different time signature, and then apply stochastic variations to these in real-time. 

The AAIM system allows the insertion of rhythmic tuplets, rests, and additional trigger, into the pattern.

Additional features include Markov chain, segment shuffling, reverse, and palindrome variations enabling the creation of a wide range of alternative pattern.

The Audio Unit can be placed as a MIDI Effect in Logic and the VST can be placed before an instrument in Reaper. In Ableton pou will need to [route the MIDI output to another channel](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209070189-Accessing-the-MIDI-output-of-a-VST-plug-in)... other DAW's will probably need a similar approach.
