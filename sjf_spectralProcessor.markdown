sjf_spectralProcessor is a 16 band graphic EQ with LFO modulation for gain and feedback delay lines for each band inspired by the Buchla 296e Spectral Processor.

The LFO modulation and delays allow for time domain spectral processing.
It is also possible to set four presets, which can then be interpolated between using the XY pad.

Further features include setting the filter order and type, as well as outputting only odd/even numbered bands.
