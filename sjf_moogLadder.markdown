sjf_moogLadder is an emulation of the moog ladder filter based on the approach of [Will Pirkle](http://www.willpirkle.com/Downloads/Addendum_A1_Moog.pdf). 
It includes four different lfo modulation waveforms for the cut-off frequency and resonance that can be set to a specific frequency or synced to the underlying tempo.
