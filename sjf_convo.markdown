sjf_convo is a convolution plug-in, designed primarily to be used as a convolution reverb but capable of convolving the input signal with any audio file (within reason as cpu usage goes up with the length of the audio file...). 

In addition to the basic convolution feature, the plug-in also enables the user to reverse, stretch, and trim the impulse response, as well as apply amplitude envelopes to the impulse response.

There are also low and high pass filters available on the output as well as a predelay function on the input.
