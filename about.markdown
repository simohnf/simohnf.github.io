I am a PhD graduate and skilled computer programmer with ten years experience developing software for creative and educational purposes. I have participated in many successful collaborative projects and disseminated my research through international presentations and peer-reviewed publications. 
 
I earned my PhD at the University of Calgary in Computational Media Design (CMD) under the supervision of Dr.  David Eagle and Dr. Jeff Boyd. During my doctorate I developed the [AAIM](/AAIM/) performance system, a portfolio of interconnectable algorithmic software modules, designed to facilitate improvisation and live performance of electronic music.  
 
I completed my MA in Sonic Arts, receiving a distinction, at the Sonic Arts Research Centre(SARC), Belfast, focussing on the composition of electroacoustic music under the supervision of Dr. Eric Lyon. 
 
Prior to this I graduated from Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), receiving first class honours, where I majored in creative music technology and composition under Mark Graham and Dr. Eric Sweeney. While at WIT I also studied Jazz guitar under Dylan Bible.

I have performed extensively in a number of jazz, rock, and electronic groups in addition to giving numerous performances as a solo guitarist and solo electronic artist.
